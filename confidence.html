        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Steps to Gaining Confidence</h1> <br><br>
        <h2>Step 1: Not Looking Scared</h2>
        <p>Improve your posture, use more open-body language, and give better eye contact. </p> <br>
        <h2>Step 2: Not Sounding Scared</h2>
        <p>Speak louder, end your sentences on a lower pitch, and use pauses when you speak. In addition, 
            be wary of your speaking rate. Don't talk too fast or slow, it will make you sound panicked
            or unsure. </p> <br>
        <h2>Step 3: Adopt a Curious Mindset</h2>
        <p>Instead of focusing on yourself, focus on the audience you are talking about. The moment you
            shift your attention away from yourself and to the audience, you'll stop being self-conscious and 
            eliminate the awkward feeling.  </p> <br>
        <h2>Step 4: Wear Clothes You're Comfortable In </h2>
        <p>A lot of the times, we judge ourselves based on what we wear. Therefore, wear clothes that make
            you feel confident while speaking. This is called enclothed cognition. The research behind 
            enclothed cognition suggests that its not so much about what we wear, but what we think about what we wear.</p><br>
        <h2>Step 5: Master Your Breathing</h2>
        <p>Oftentimes, normal (chest) breathing doesn't supply enough oxygen for a long speech, which can lead to 
            shortness of breath. This can make you found nervous or jittery. To fix this, make sure to take deep 
            breaths at a controlled pace when you take a pause in your speech. Additionally, make sure to take a 
            strong breath <b>before</b> you start speaking. </p><br>
        <h2>Step 6: Say Your Speech Out Loud</h2>
        <p>Saying your speech out loud will help you be more familiar with the flow of the words, which is important 
            in order to reduce stuttering. Stuttering makes you sound nervous, and to avoid that you must familiarize yourself
            with the pronounciation of the words. This will also help you ingrain your speech in your head more so you don't have
            to look down at your notecards 24/7. </p><br>
        <h2>Step 7: Sound Happy</h2>
        <p>Whatever emotion you sound actually induces the same emotion in the audience. Studies have shown that 
            there is a direct correlation between how our voices sound and how we feel. Thus, sounding happier 
            will make the audience happier to listen to you as well. </p>
        <p>Additionally, to reduce nervousness, pretend you're having a conversation with a specific audience 
            member. Speak as if you're having a converation with a friend, which will make you more relaxed and 
            allow the audience to warm up to you. It will also give the audience an impression of closeness and friendship, which 
            will make them want to listen to you more. </p> <br>
        <h2>Step 8: Channel Your Fear</h2>
        <p>Use your nervous energy and channel it into passion. When you're speaking and you feel your heart racing or your 
            palms sweating, reframe the 'nervousness' emotion as excitement. Then, you'll sound more passionate and into 
            what you're speaking about.
