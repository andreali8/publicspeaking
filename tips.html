        <h1>Use Rhetorical Devices</h1>
        <p>Rhetorical devices are similar to literary devices.
          They can be similies, metaphors, anecdotes or language patterns that
          are purposefully placed to sway the audience. Rhetorical
          devices make a speech interesting, as most people would
          rather listen to a story compared to a boring ramble.</p>

        <p>While speaking to an audience, remember to keep in mind your audience's 
          capacity for remembering information. Breaking down your message into three
          parts makes it more catchy and easier to remember.</p>
        <p><i><b>FAMOUS EXAMPLES:</b><br></i>
            <br>"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness." <i>-Declaration of Independence</i> <br>

        <h1>Use Hand Gestures</h1>
        <p>Using hand gestures will help bring your speech to life. Not only that, but using hand gestures makes
          the audience pay attention to your speech more. In fact, research done about body language found that 
          using hand gestures increased the value of spoken messages by more than 65 percent! Watch the video on 
          the right to compare the huge difference between using hand gestures and not using them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For example, using your fingers to list out an ordered list of things can bring the list greater attention 
        by the audience. This is especially true if you want to emphasize on a number of things. 
        <br></p>
        <p>You can also use your hands to gesture to the size of something. For example, if you're saying that something 
        is huge or growing, you should stretch your hands out and indicate that it's big. </p>

        <h1 class="body-lang">Body Language Awareness</h1>
        <p class="body-lang">Nonverbal techniques are essential for capturing your audience's attention. Having good body language is 
          essential to conveying your message, as it adds to your sincerity, confidence, and credibility. To be 
          a successful speaker, you must be in control of your posture (poise), facial expressions, and overall body
          language. 
          <br><br> 
          Some examples can be:
          <br><br>
          <b><i>Maintain eye contact.</i></b> This will establish an immediate bond with the audience and keep them engaged. 
          <br><br>
          <b><i>Acting out verbs.</i></b> Acting out what you are saying can leave a bigger impact on the audience and keep them more engaged.
          <br><br>
          <b><i>Use Hand Gestures.</i></b> See above.
          <br><br>
          <b><i>Avoid Self-Touch.</i></b>When people are nervous, they will often do things like cracking their knuckles or
          putting their hands in their pockets. This will make you seem unconfident and uncomfortable. To avoid this, 
          busy your hands with something (like hand gestures) or hold a clicker for presentations. 
          <br><br>
          <b><i>Take up space.</i></b> Don't just stand in one place, take up the entire stage.
          <br><br>
          While using all these techniques are good, it is important to not overuse any of them to not seem too over the top.
          For example, staring incessently into one person in the audience to "maintain eye contact" is too much.

        <h1>Speak Clearly</h1>
        <br>
        <p>In order to leave a lasting message, one needs to speak so the audience can understand
          the message. <br><br>

          Some examples are:
          <br><br>
          <i><b>Using proper articulation.</b></i> Without properly articulating (sounding out/pronouncing) your words 
          it will take the audience more effort to understand what you're saying. In short, pronounce every syllable of
          the words you're saying and not slur over any.
          <br><br>
          <i><b>Speaking at the proper volume.</b></i> Some may think the louder the better, but speaking too loud can 
          distract the audience from your message because you're screaming and their ears are in pain.
          <br><br>
          <i><b>Practice saying your speech.</b></i> Only by practicing saying the words in your speech will you 
          understand what movements your mouth and tongue have to make in order to form the words correctly.

      </div>
      
      <div class="tone">
        <h1>Tone</h1>
        <p>The tone you speak is very important. Make sure to vary your tone and pace, as a monotone voice
          can be unenjoyable and boring. To add tone, you can elongate the sounds and add emotion into your words.
          For example, speed your pace up a little when talking about something exciting! Or, pause before a 
          'big reveal'. Or, stretch a word out to put emphasis on it. Make sure to use inflection, emphasis,
          and pauses to add interest to your speech. Tonality is what truly allows the speaker to connect to
          the audience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition, make sure to never have an apologetic or unsure tone while giving a speech. Having 
          either one can discredit you as a speaker, as it will make the audience question if you are 
          qualified to talk about the topic you're speaking about. If you sound unsure, then why should 
          we, the audience, trust you?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Bonus: When speaking, end your sentences in a lower pitch instead of a higher pitch. Ending in a lower 
          pitch generally makes the audience believe that you know what you're talking about. However, the same can't 
          be said about the latter. Try it out yourself!

        <h1>Connect With the Audience</h1>
        <p>Overall, it is crucial to connect and engage with the audience. The goal of the speaker
          is to make the audience listen, and the audience doesn't listen unless the speaker makes them by 
          engaging with them. 
        </p>
        <p>For example:
          <br> Have a laughter mindset-- be smiling throughout the speech and pop a joke or two, even if the topic is serious. 
          This will connect to the audience and make the people feel like you're talking to an 'old friend'. Some simple 
          things you can do to lighten the mood can be as simple as raising an eyebrow or letting out an exasperated sigh.
