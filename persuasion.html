        <h1>Ethos, Pathos, Logos</h1>
        <p>To be a successful speaker, one needs to utilize Ethos, Pathos, and Logos, which are </p>
        <p><b><i>Ethos</i></b> refers to the appeal to credibility. The speaker can communicate
        their authority over the subject by using credible sources, having proper credentials, and choosing
        the appropriate language (using no slang and correct pronounciation of words). </p>
        <p><b><i>Pathos</i></b> refers to the appeal to emotion. It means to persuade an audience
        by purposefully evoking the audience's emotions. Speakers can do this by 
        telling impactful stories, making deliberate word choices, and using the correct
        tones that evoke emotion. </p> 
        <p><b><i>Logos</i></b> refers to the appeal to logic. To use logos, the speaker
        needs to make clear, logical connections between ideas, using things like facts or statistics. 
        There should be no fallacies, or assumptions, in the logical reasoning the speaking is making.</p>

      <h1>Examples of Ethos, Logos, and Pathos</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Imagine this: a small dog sits in a dark, cold garage. His hair is matted and dirty; 
        he is skinny and weak from going days without food. There is no water for him to drink,
         no person to give him love and no blanket to keep him warm at night. While this might be
          a hard scenario to imagine, it is not an uncommon one in America today. According to 
          the Humane Society of the United States, nearly 1,000,000 animals are abused or die 
          from abuse every year. As a veterinarian with 30 years of experience, I have seen how 
          even one incident of abuse can affect an animal for the rest of its life. As a society, 
          we need to be more aware of this terrible problem and address this issue before it gets worse.</p>

              even one incident of abuse can affect an animal for the rest of its life.</i></p> 
            <p>This is ethos because it is appealing to the author's credibility, which is established when the author states
              their own experiences and occupation. The author has a lot of experience dealing with mistreated animals, and thus 
              is reliable.

            <p>This is logos because the author is using a reliable resource as a statistic to appeal to our intellect.</p>

            <p><i>There is no water for him to drink, no person to give him love and no blanket to keep him warm at night.</i></p>
            <p>This is pathos because the author is using the sad story of the dog to evoke an emotional reaction from 
              the reader. The author is trying to make the reader feel sadness and pity for the mistreated animal.  </p>
